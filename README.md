# Perfume-ad

This is the second challenge I do with Frontend Mentor.
It was a promotional page for a perfume.

Just a watch made to train the concepts of HTML AND CSS. 

## 🚀 Starting

These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com). 
Also it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 🎲 Running the Back End

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/raphaeltcf/perfume-ad

# Access the project folder in terminal/cmd
$ cd perfume-ad

# Run the app in the Browser
```
